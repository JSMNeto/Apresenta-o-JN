# Hey there! 😉
## I'm Jorge, it's a pleasure to have you here! 👋🏼

🇧🇷 I was born and raised in São Paulo/Brazil, am **passionate about Martial Arts and Technology**, and graduated in Business Administration. I have worked in many areas such as Sales, Marketing, Customer Service and Logistics; nowadays I am transitioning  to IT, more precisely to Cloud Computing and Machine Learning. Although I love tech, my life took a different path and I couldn't study it from an early age.

</p>

🥋 **Martial Arts** has taught me much more than self-defence; it **helped me to improve my soft skills like self-control, critical thinking, balance, strong will, humbleness, empathy**, and how to have a deep connection between mind and body.

</p>

👨🏻‍💻 About **Technology**, I think that what I like the most is **pragmatism, precision, organization, logical thinking** and the capability of working from any place, in a team with people from everywhere and creating almost everything that we want or need, all together.

</p>

👷🏻‍♂️ **I am building my path in this career**, so you will be able to follow my progress from the very beginning since I am going to upload regularly every new learning.

</p>

*Thank you, and have a good stay!*
